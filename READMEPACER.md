## Introduction

The core objective of this work is the development of a flexible, efficient, and verifiable computational model for real-time virtual hearts. This virtual heart is intended for the closed-loop validation of cardiac devices. The proposed framework supports device testing within an in-silico closed-loop context of patient physiology.

### Background

Traditional biophysically-based heart models rely on coupled differential equations, making them computationally costly to solve and unsuitable for real-time emulation or formal verification. 
To overcome this challenge while retaining dynamic physiological features, the models utilize the Hybrid Automaton (HA) formalism. 
HA models retain computational efficiency while supporting the modeling of continuous membrane voltage evolution and distinct action potential phases.

The heart is represented as an abstracted network of nodes (regional tissue clusters) connected by edges.

</p> 

### Model Descriptions

The heart model is organized into libraries, models, and scripts. Each component is designed for specific role.  
- The [Lib ](./Lib/) folder contains the core component libraries, including cell models (pacemaker, myocyte, and subsidiary pacemaker cells), conduction paths, EGM sensing modules, and pacemaker devices, with separate versions for millisecond- and second-based simulations. 
- The [models ](./models/) provides pre-built examples, ranging from single-cell pacemaker models to full heart simulations, allowing users to quickly run simulations or test specific scenarios. 
- For more detailed or high-resolution variants, the [models_refine ](./models_refine/) contains complex heart models with increased numbers of nodes and paths. 
- The [src ](./src/) hosts all utility scripts, including automatic model builders, configuration processors, GUI tools, plotting functions, and parameter generators, enabling users to customize and automate simulations. 

#### Model Libraries

Two versions of library exist:  [Libs.slx](./Lib/Libs.slx) & [Libs_second.slx](./Lib/Libs_second.slx)
<br> Same components but adapted for second based simulation for hardware integration ([Notes on Modification from Milliseconds (ms) to Seconds](#notes-on-modification-from-milliseconds-ms-to-seconds)).

#### Notes on Modification from Milliseconds (ms) to Seconds 

The model was originally developed using **milliseconds (ms)** as the simulation time.  
For hardware integration, it has been modified to use **seconds (s)**. The key modifications are:

- **Node_N_V6 / Automaton / function rr=RR(...) / line 27:**   `y =bff'*2*pi*pt`: removed `/1000` in **Libs_second.slx**.
- **Sensing / Chart and Sensing / Chart3:**  
  Use `temporalCount(msec)` and `after(3,msec)` in **Libs_second.slx**.  
  In **Libs.slx**, the original code uses `temporalCount(sec)` and `after(3,sec)`.
- **Libs_second / Path_V3 / Path (Buffer_i and Buffer_j):**  
  Thresholds changed: `tbi >= 599` → `tbi >= 0.599`, `tbj >= 599` → `tbj >= 0.599`.  
  Note: This only affects action potentials where APD > 600 ms.
- **CLK Modules (inputs to Sensing, Pre_eventsv1, Ratesv1, Cnds_DDDv1, PMTv1, PM_DDD_v3):**  
  Set `Period(secs) = 0.001`.
- **Timing parameters of sensing and pacemaker modules:**  
  Remain the same (use ms).
- Use **Heart_N3_second.xlsx**, which contains modified parameters for simulation time in seconds.

## Cell Models

Cell model is developed as a computational HA pacemaker cell model with the ability to efficiently describe dynamic electrical behaviors and adaptation to pacing frequency, and compares.
The HA model can be parameterized to capture the features of different cardiac pacemaker cells.

### Cell Types Overview

The cardiac conduction system is represented using three main cell types:
  1. Pacemaker Cells (Type N)
      Cells with intrinsic automaticity that spontaneously initiate action potentials.
  2. Myocytes (Type M)
      Contractile myocardial cells that propagate electrical signals but do not normally self-excite.
  3. Subsidiary Pacemakers (Type NM)
      Cells that combine automaticity with fast-response conduction behavior.

Together these cell types form a modular and extensible heart model capable of reproducing normal rhythm formation as well as pathological pacing scenarios.

### Pacemaker Cells (Type N)

Pacemaker cells represent autorhythmic cells found in regions such as the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN). These cells are capable of spontaneously generating action potentials without external stimulation, with the SAN acting as the dominant intrinsic pacemaker under normal conditions.
In the model, pacemaker cells:
-Exhibit automaticity through slow diastolic depolarization
-Support rate adaptation and overdrive suppression
-Capture key refractory behaviors relevant to rhythm control
-Can be influenced by electrical stimuli from neighboring cells or pacing devices

The following figure shows the HA state flow chart of nodal type cell capture the distinct phases of the cardiac action potential.
Complex ionic dynamics are abstracted into a small set of continuous variables and discrete states.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/node_n_ha.png" alt="node n ha" width="90%">
</p> 

It consists of four discrete states corresponding to the phases of the nodal action potential:
- Slow Depolarization (Phase 4)
    Represents spontaneous diastolic depolarization and is responsible for the intrinsic automaticity of pacemaker cells.
- Upstroke (Phase 0)
    Models rapid depolarization initiated either spontaneously or by external electrical stimulation.
- Plateau& Early Repolarization (Phase 2)
    Captures sustained depolarization following excitation.
- Final Repolarization (Phase 3)
    Represents voltage recovery back to the maximal diastolic potential before the next pacing cycle.

State transitions are governed by voltage thresholds, refractory conditions, and interactions with neighboring cells.

### Myocytes (Type M)

Myocytes represent atrial and ventricular myocardial cells responsible for electrical conduction and mechanical contraction. Unlike pacemaker cells, myocytes do not normally initiate action potentials on their own and instead respond to incoming electrical stimuli.
In the model, myocytes:
 - Propagate action potentials through conduction pathways
 - Exhibit fast-response electrical behavior
These cells form the most of the cardiac conduction network.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/node_m_ha.png" alt="node_m_ha" width="90%">
</p> 

The above figure shows the myocyte HA cell model  which also consists of four discrete states corresponding to the major phases of the action potential:
-  Resting / Final Repolarization(Phase 0)
-  Stimulated (Phase 1)
-  Upstroke (Phase 2)
-  Plateau / Early Repolarization (Phase 3)

### Subsidiary Pacemakers (Type NM)

Subsidiary Pacemakers Cells exhibit hybrid behaviour: behave electrophysiologically like cardiomyocytes with fast-response conduction behavior, while also possessing intrinsic automaticity similar to nodal pacemaker cells.
To capture this behavior, the Type NM cell is modeled by composing a nodal pacemaker cell with a fast-response cardiomyocyte.

The model consists of:
 - Cell A (nodal): Provides intrinsic pacemaking
 - Cell C (cardiomyocyte): Generates the observable action potential
Both cells are connected by a path with zero propagation delay. External stimulation is applied only to Cell C, while Cell A interacts solely through internal electrical coupling.

Functional Behavior:
 1. Low or absent external stimulation:
     Pacemaking originates from Cell A and activates Cell C.
 2. High-rate external stimulation:
     Cell C is directly driven by the stimulus, suppressing Cell A through overdrive inhibition.

This configuration preserves fast-response action potential dynamics, APD restitution, and rate-dependent suppression of automaticity, consistent with physiological subsidiary pacemakers.

## Path Model

Nodes in the heart model are connected using a time-delayed path model that captures the characteristics of action potential propagation in cardiac tissue.
Each path models the electrical coupling between two nodes and determines whether an activation propagates from node i to node j (or vice versa) after a conduction delay. The propagation direction depends on activation timing, conduction velocity, and the refractory state of the connected cells.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/path_ha.png" alt="path_ha" width="90%">
</p> 

The path model is implemented as a hybrid automaton (HA) as showen in the above figure.<br>
which ;
   - Selects the propagation direction based on activation timing
   - Enforces refractory constraints at the receiving node
   - Detects and annihilates colliding action potentials
   - Prevents bidirectional feedback

Path model accurately captures:Directional conduction, Conduction block, Action potential collision and annihilation, Rate-dependent propagation delays
By replacing long chains of cells with efficient path abstractions, the model enables scalable, real-time simulation of large cardiac conduction networks for closed-loop pacemaker validation.
 
## Closed Loop System
### Pacemaker Model

The closed-loop system integrates a DDD-mode pacemaker model with the virtual heart model to enable realistic device testing and simulation. The pacemaker senses atrial and ventricular activity through intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) generated by the heart model and delivers pacing stimuli when intrinsic activity is absent or insufficient.

The model supports dual-chamber sensing and pacing, atrioventricular timing control, refractory period enforcement, and rate limits, allowing evaluation of pacemaker behavior under both normal and pathological cardiac conditions. This closed-loop coupling enables in-silico validation of sensing, pacing, and timing logic in response to dynamic cardiac electrophysiology.

## Getting Started

**2. Overdrive suppression simulation**

If a pacemaker cell is depolarized at a higher frequency than its intrinsic rate, its automaticity may be suppressed, which is known as overdrive suppression.

## Acknowledgment

1. The cardiomyocytes model [2] is based on the work [8] and the initial Simulink implementaion is from the Oxford group [9].
2. The initial topology of the cardiac conduction system [3] is from the work [10].
3. The DDD pacemaker is modified based on a published model [11].

## Need-to-know

* In the path model, only the voltage during q3 contribute to the activation of its neighbouring cells, which is an approximation.
* If the action potential of a cardiomyocyte is greater than the VO during q3 location at given parameters, e.g., out of the physiological range, the output would be saturated to VO. A better saturation approach can be found in the references [5,6], which only saturates the overshoot at the end of q2.
* The models are implemented to facilitate parameterization. The parameters can be updated at run time. For fixed parameters application, the implementation can be simplified. Please refer to the papers [1-4] for the model descriptions.
* The GUI is not fully tested.
