# HeartModelPub

This project includes pacemaker cell models [1], cardiomyocytes [2,3], the cardiac conduction system [3] and EGM generation [4], which are implemented in Matlab/Simulink. We have demonstrated the in-silico validation of a DDD mode pacemaker with the virtual physiological heart model in the closed-loop [5]. For C code generation and implementation using Piha, please refer to [6][7].

## Getting Started  

### Add the library files to the path

To set up, add all the library files to the search path for the current MATLAB® session by running the following in the Matlab command window: 
>> setup_Heart

### Run model simulations  
	
All the running examples are under the directory *models* or *models_refine*, firstly go to the directory by clicking the folder or running the following in the Matlab command window:     
>> cd models	
1. Automaticity simulation of pacemaker cell models  
In the folder, there are three pacemaker cell models: (1) SA node model "SAcell.slx", (2) AV node model "CNcell.slx", and (3) His-Purkinje fibre cell "HPScell.slx".
Pacemaker cells can initiate action potentials without external stimulation. To simulate the models:    		 
    1. Open a cell model, such as "SAcell.slx" , and click "Run" button in Simulink or run the simulation using the Matlab commands:  
	>> open('SAcell.slx')  
	>> sim('SAcell.slx')       		 
    2. Once the simulation finishes, click the scope to view the output trace. 	
2. Overdrive suppression simulation: apply external stimuli to a pacemaker cell and observe the overdrive suppression phenomenon. The model "AV.slx" is connected with a pulse, and the script "simAV_Trace.m" is provided to simulate the model.  
   1. Run the following in the Matlab command window:  
	>> simAV_Trace	   	 
   2. Once the simulation finishes, "Plottrace.m" can be used to plot the simulation traces:       
	>> Plottrace  	
3. Run a heart model without external pacing pulses	  
   1. Open HeartExe.slx and click "Run" in Simulink, or run the following in the Matlab command window:     
	>> open('HeartExe.slx')   
	>> sim('HeartExe.slx')	 	 
   2. Once the simulation finishes, the specified action potentials can be printed out by running the following in the Matlab command window:          
	>> load('Cells.mat')     
	>> plotCells		   
4. Run a heart model with a pacemaker device    
   1. Run the following in the Matlab command window:         
    >> RunCLSfixed     	     
   2. In the GUI, enter the simulation time (ms) in the box under "Stop" within Operations panel on the left.     		 
   3. Click "Start" within Operations panel.      
The electrical activations of the cardiac conduction system is shown on the left (red triangles denote depolarization and blue ones indicate repolarization) and the EGMs are displayed on the right.    		 
   4. Click "Stop" within Operations panel and close the GUI window.         
5. Build a new heart model     
     Refer to PreBuild.m.   

## Model description 

### The parameter files  

* Heart_N3.xlsx, the parameters of the heart model with simulation time in msec 
* Heart_N3_second.xlsx, the parameters of the heart model with simulation time in second

### Model Libs      
- Node_N_V6.slx: pacemaker cell model, nodal type, update parameters at the beginning of the slow depolarization, compute t3 and t0 before updating, and compute d2 and d1 after updating;	  
- Node_M_V4.slx, cardiac myocyte model with interface to path model, only update parameters before start new cycle (before enter q1);	  
- Path_V3.slx, path model;  	
- Node_NM_V4.slx, subsidiary pacemaker cell model;

- PM_DDD_v3.slx, DDD mode pacemaker;	  
- HeartV9.slx, heart model.  
 
### Notes on the modification of milliseconds (ms) to second 
The model was initially developed using milliseconds (ms) as the simulation time. For hardware integration, we have modified it to use seconds as the simulation time. The modifications include:   
- Node_N_V6/Automaton/function rr= RR(pbcl,psd,pf1,pf2,psigma1sq,psigma2sq,pt)/ line 27, y = ff'*2*pi*pt: removed /1000 in Libs_second.slx
- Sensing/Chart and Sensing/Chart3: use temporalCount(msec) and after(3,msec) in Libs_second.slx; Libs.slx uses temporalCount(sec) and after(3,sec);
- Libs_second/Path_V3/Path, Buffer_i and j, tbi>=599 changed to tbi>=0.599, tbj\>=599 changed to tbj\>=0.599; This only has effects when the APD>600 ms.
-  The clk modules as the inputs to the modules: Sensing, Pre_eventsv1, Ratesv1, Cnds_DDDv1, PMTv1 and PM_DDD_v3 should set Period(secs) =0.001;
- The timing parameters of sensing and pacemaker modules remain the same (using ms).
- Use Heart_N3_second.xlsx, which contains modified parameters for simulation time as second.

## Need-to-know
* In the path model, only the voltage during q3 contribute to the activation of its neighbouring cells, which is an approximation.
* If the action potential of a cardiomyocyte is greater than the VO during q3 location at given parameters, e.g., out of the physiological range, the output would be saturated to VO. A better saturation approach can be found in the references [5,6], which only saturates the overshoot at the end of q2.
* The models are implemented to facilitate parameterization. The parameters can be updated at run time. For fixed parameters application, the implementation can be simplified. Please refer to the papers [1-4] for the model descriptions.
* The GUI is not fully tested.
